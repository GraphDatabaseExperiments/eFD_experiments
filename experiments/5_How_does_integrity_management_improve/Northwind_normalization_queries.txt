As the nodes labelled Customer already carried the property customerID as well as the nodes labelled Order we did not create new nodes to transfer the properties in XY, but transferred these instead to the corresponding Customer nodes.

This means there is also no need to create new edges in this case.



Updating customer nodes and remove properties from order nodes


MATCH (o:Order),(c:Customer) WHERE
EXISTS(c.customerID) AND
EXISTS(o.customerID) AND
(o.customerID = c.customerID) AND
EXISTS(o.shipCity) AND
EXISTS(o.shipName) AND
EXISTS(o.shipPostalCode) AND
EXISTS(o.shipCountry) AND
EXISTS(o.shipAddress) AND
EXISTS(o.shipRegion)
SET c.shipCity = o.shipCity
REMOVE o.shipCity
SET c.shipName = o.shipName
REMOVE o.shipName
SET c.shipPostalCode = o.shipPostalCode
REMOVE o.shipPostalCode
SET c.shipCountry = o.shipCountry
REMOVE o.shipCountry
SET c.shipAddress = o.shipAddress
REMOVE o.shipAddress
SET c.shipRegion = o.shipRegion
REMOVE o.shipRegion




Remove customerID in orders (as no foreign key required anymore)

MATCH (o:Order) REMOVE o.customerID
