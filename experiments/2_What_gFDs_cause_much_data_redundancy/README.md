# What gFDs cause much data redundancy

Among the gFDs we have mined in our datasets we are particularly interested in the ones that cause high levels of redundancy. Information on these gFDs can guide the process of deciding which gFDs are consdidered to be meaningful and express business rules.

Additional information on the gFDs mined in the Norhwind and Offshore dataset can be found in this folder including the redundancy caused by these gFDs as well as the maximum cardinality which is associated with the size of the biggest equivalence class for a given gFD representing the maximum amount of inconsistency.
