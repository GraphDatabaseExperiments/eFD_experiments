Normalising:

Create country vertices


MATCH (e:Entity)

WITH DISTINCT e.countries AS countries, e.country_codes as codes

Create relationships and remove properties from entity vertices

MATCH (e:Entity),(l:Location)
WHERE EXISTS(e.countries) AND EXISTS(e.country_codes) AND EXISTS(e.jurisdiction_description) AND EXISTS(e.service_provider) AND
e.countries = l.countries

How much redundancy saved by normalising (perform query on denormalised graph):


MATCH (e:Entity) WHERE
EXISTS(e.jurisdiction_description) AND
EXISTS(e.countries) AND
EXISTS(e.service_provider) AND
EXISTS(e.country_codes)
WITH e.countries AS countries, COUNT(e.countries) AS dist WHERE dist > 1
RETURN SUM(dist)
