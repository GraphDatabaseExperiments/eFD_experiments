# Normalizing Graph Data (!!!!!!!!! Check if title changed)

## Introduction:

This Github repository complements our research on embedded uniqueness contraints (eUC) and embedded functional dependencies (eFD) for property graphs.

In particular, this repository is comprised of the following:

- source code (written in Python) that outlines how experiments on synthetic datasets have been conducted
- images illustrating the experiments on graph datasets
- dump files (Neo4j format) containing the real world datasets used to conduct experiments
- files and instructions on how to replicate experiments



## Preliminaries:

What software, files, etc needed to perform experiments






## Experiments:

Which experiments have been conducted, enumerate and refer to files to replicate them.
