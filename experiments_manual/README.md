# Manual to replicate experiments

This manual will provide a step by step guide on how to get set up to replicate the experiments discussed in our research.

In particular, this folder contains information on the following:

- instructions on how to set up Neo4j
- information on how to import dump files in Neo4j Desktop
- details on how to run Python in conjunction with Neo4j

## Setting up Neo4j: 

We will present two options to set up Neo4j. Using Neo4j Browser in an online environment called the [Neo4j Sandbox](https://neo4j.com/sandbox/) is the quickest and easiest way, yet will be limited to replicating experiments using the Offshore dataset. For full usability and to replicate all experiments discussed we show how to obtain [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/) and set it up.
