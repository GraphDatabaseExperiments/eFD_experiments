For convenience this folder contains the Northwind dataset used in our experiments in graphml format as well as CSV format for import.

In addtion for the much larger Offshore dataset we recommend to import the [dump file](https://github.com/ICIJ/offshoreleaks-data-packages/blob/main/data/icij-offshoreleaks-42.dump) into Neo4j as outlined in the experiments manual and use the [APOC export procedures](https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.1/export/) supported by Neo4j to export these into different file formats for import in Amazon Neptune for example.
