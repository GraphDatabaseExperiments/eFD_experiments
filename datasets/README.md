This folder contains the Northwind dataset used in our experiments in graphml format as well as CSV format for import in an S3 bucket.

In addtion for the much larger Offshore dataset we recommend to import the dump file as outlined in the manual and use the [APOC export procedures](https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.1/export/) supported by Neo4j to export these into different file formats.
